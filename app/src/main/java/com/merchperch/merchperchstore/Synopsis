 The present scenario for shopping is to visit the shops and market manually and then from the available product list one needs to choose the item he or she wants and then pay for the same item mainly in cash mode is done, as not every society is well educated and aware to use net banking or card modes or wallets etc.
This system is not much user-friendly as one needs to go to the market physically and then select items only from the available list. So mostly it is difficult to get the product as per our desire. Description About the products is less available and are mostly verbal only. For this type of shopping, one needs to have an ample amount of free time.
Also, not really good markets exist everywhere, so many times good markets become out of reach for certain people.
